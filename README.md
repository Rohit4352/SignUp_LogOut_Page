# SignUp_LogOut_Page
Working on the page 
There are two different pages "sign up" and "Profile"

Sign Up: consists of input fields and stores the inputs' value in local storage once the **Continue** button is pressed. 

From there the next page i.e. Profile page is loaded with the user's details inserted on the previous page. 

Profile: This page shows the key and values stored in local storage. The **LogOut** button is used to delete the access token and revert to the signUp page. 

NOTE: validator functions

> 
> checkProfile(): to check if no token exists in storage user is only able to load the signUp page.
>
